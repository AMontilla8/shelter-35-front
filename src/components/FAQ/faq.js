          <li>
            Yes you do. Shelter35  is a cloud-based website, meaning that your Meow's are backed up and available wherever you are.

          <li>
          Sorry to hear that. We do hear that, alas, on just about every joke that is even slightly offensive. Please read the Page Warning again.
